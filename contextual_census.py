contextual_census.py — the contextual census, built as a falsification test.

QLF's phase question is closed: `phase_rule` (lean/QLF_PhaseRule.lean) proves that a
count-balanced history folds to

    phi(h) = (-1)^(#negative twists + inversions of its axis word) . I

and QLF_BasisIndependence proves the stored (X, Y, Z) alphabet is a coordinate chart, not a
preferred physical basis. What is left open is the *partition*: which histories count as the
joint closure of a preparation P, an apparatus M, and a result c. That set,

    J(P, M, c),

is the one remaining freedom, and a freely-chosen one would reproduce any amplitudes at all
(Philosophy.md 3a rule 4). So this script fixes it by the only substrate-native rule available
-- **a run is a way exactly when preparation, system strand and apparatus close together** --
and then measures, without fitting anything:

    A(c) = sum over s of phi(P ++ s ++ M_c),   over system strands s that make the run close
    P(c) = A(c)^2 / sum_k A(k)^2

Design commitments, so the result can falsify rather than accommodate:

  * the phase is the **proven formula**, never a matrix product -- a failure here cannot be
    blamed on an approximate phase model;
  * a **preparation is an unbalanced strand** (an open strand needing closure), not merely a
    string prefix -- a balanced prefix prepares nothing, and the script refuses one;
  * preparation and apparatus are specified **independently**, and the contribution map is
    relational, K = K(P, M): neither side alone decides which strands close;
  * every geometry is run at **increasing finite horizons** and reported as a scaling table,
    never at a single hand-picked horizon;
  * a battery of geometries is printed **together and blind** -- no per-case tuning.

It is also a checker. Two consequences of the Lean theorems are asserted against the numbers:
symmetric branch pairs must give exactly equal amplitudes (QLF_BasisIndependence), and the
DP must agree with brute-force enumeration wherever brute force is affordable.

What it found (reproduce with --depth-scan 3 --max-k 18)
--------------------------------------------------------
The transverse geometries are pinned to exactly 1/2 at every horizon, which is not evidence
about anything: QLF_BasisIndependence *forces* it, since the two branches are exchanged by a
relabeling that fixes the preparation. A number forced by a proven symmetry is bookkeeping
(Philosophy.md 3a rule 4), and the script prints it only as a regression check.

The aligned geometries are the informative ones, and they say something the framework has to
answer for: **for any fixed preparation, the contextual weight washes out toward 1/2 as the
horizon grows.** The branch ratio A(-)/A(+) climbs monotonically at every horizon computed --
at depth 1: 0, .125, .200, .267, .327, .381, .429, .472, .511, .546 through k = 18, reaching
.677 at k = 28 where P(+) has fallen to .686 -- and a deeper preparation only delays it (depth 2
is still .936 at k = 28, but its ratio is rising too). Conversely, letting the depth grow with
the horizon drives the weight to 1. Two independent code paths (recomputing the census per
horizon, and reusing one incrementally) agree exactly at every overlapping horizon.

So this partition does **not** define a horizon-independent contextual probability: the number
is set by the ratio of preparation depth to horizon, and both limits are degenerate (1/2 one
way, 1 the other). The limit itself is not proven -- monotone data through k = 18 is not a
theorem -- but it is enough to say a further principle is needed to fix the regime.

**Indexing does not rescue it, and that is now checked rather than assumed.** The obvious suspicion
is that the flat `P ++ s ++ M_c` is at fault: it puts system and apparatus in one Pauli algebra, where
distinct axes anticommute, whereas independent factors commute (QLF_IndexedFactors). Recomputing with
the system on factor 1 and the apparatus on factor 2 -- which deletes exactly the cross-inversion term
between `s` and `M_c` -- gives **identical probabilities at every horizon**, for aligned, transverse and
mixed geometries alike.

The reason is structural, not a coincidence: a strand's **axis parity is determined by its imbalance**
(`n_X = #> + #<` and `imbalance_X = #> - #<` agree mod 2, and likewise for Y and Z), so within the one
imbalance class that a branch selects, the cross term is a *constant sign*. A global sign per branch
cannot survive `|A|^2`. So the flat/indexed distinction is **invisible to Born weights here**, and the
wash-out is a property of the partition itself.

The listening horizon: run, and it does not rescue the partition (--listening 2,3,4)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Closure is **capacity-relative** (`closedAtHorizon_iff_maxExcursion_le`,
lean/QLF_ClosureDepthLaw.lean), so the candidate fix was to read the weight at the observer's
listening horizon rather than at k -> infinity: keep only runs whose free action
(twist_core.spatial_free_action + local_free_action, maximised over prefixes -- the multi-pair
form of Lean's `maxExcursion`) never exceeds a capacity R. That is now measured, and it fails,
for a reason sharper than the wash-out it was meant to cure:

  * **At every capacity the aligned weight still decays to exactly 1/2**, and the capacity only
    sets the rate: |P(+) - 1/2| falls by 0.666, 0.868, 0.906 per twist at R = 2, 3, 4, so a
    preparation stays readable for tau = 2.5, 7.1, 10.1 twists. **A larger listening horizon
    remembers longer, and forgets just as completely.**
  * **What a long run keeps of the preparation is not its direction.** Against an asymmetric
    branch pair (one no relabeling can exchange, so nothing is symmetry-forced) the limit does
    depend on the preparation -- three distinct values at R = 3, one per axis class -- but a
    preparation and its **reversal** land on the same limit, exactly: `/` with `\\`, `/>` with
    `/<`, `/^` with `/v`. The sense of the prepared strand, which is precisely what a Born weight
    must depend on, is erased; only its axis class survives.
  * **Mechanism, not coincidence.** At fixed capacity the walk is a finite signed transfer
    operator whose leading eigenvalue is a degenerate +-i.lambda(R) pair (lambda = 3.991, 4.383,
    4.638 at R = 2, 3, 4, each with a 16-fold top modulus). Every preparation collapses onto that
    same dominant subspace; the direction-carrying part lives in subdominant modes and decays no
    slower than the spectral gap lambda2/lambda1 = 0.752, 0.951, 0.979.
  * **A roundoff trap, recorded because it produced a wrong answer first.** In floating point the
    subdominant part sinks under the roundoff floor at k* ~ 16 ln 10 / ln(lambda1/lambda2) -- about
    730 twists at R = 3 -- and past that the arithmetic noise, which does overlap the dominant
    subspace, is what the ratio reports: every preparation appears to converge to one universal
    limit. It does not. The scan is exact-integer by default for this reason.

So capacity does not fix the regime, and the whole family of long-horizon readings is closed:
whatever carries a Born weight is in the **transient**, at horizons comparable to the preparation
itself, which is the regime the depth scan already showed to be depth-to-horizon-ratio dependent.
Physically the substrate is saying something reasonable -- free evolution inside a bounded capacity
thermalises, and a measurement is a prompt joint closure, not an infinite free run -- but it is not
yet a Born rule.

(Terminology: "listening" is this repo's established name for the capacity-relative count -- what
a horizon of capacity R can close, as against the absolute count of ways. It is a **physical closure
capacity**, a property of which histories can close at all, not an observer's act; measurement has
no potency here.)

First joint closure: the event ends the history (--first-closure 3)
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Every scan above asks what the weight is after a prescribed k further twists, which lets a run that
already closed at depth 4 keep contributing at 5, 6, ... 700 -- and that continuation is what mixes
the census until direction is gone. But a closure IS an event; continuing past it is a longer,
different history. So the absorbing census stops each run at its **first joint closure**, whichever
branch closes it: the run chooses its own stopping depth, and no k is chosen by us. Closure with
outcome c happens exactly when the running imbalance reaches -imbalance(M_c), so the branches
compete for one absorbing hit. Cross-checked against enumeration.

What it changes, and what it does not:

  * **Direction reaches the outcome again.** Reversing the preparation changes the weights --
    P(+) = 0.688 vs 0.312 on the ZX-mix at R = 3, and 1.000 vs 0.878 for a branch pair no
    relabeling can exchange. Under every long-horizon reading a preparation and its reversal shared
    one limit exactly; under first closure they do not. The aligned geometry closes at depth 0 with
    P(+) = 1 exactly, at every capacity, and nothing else ever closes.
  * **But the complementarity is symmetry-forced, so it is bookkeeping.** Where the two branches are
    exchanged by a relabeling that also reverses the preparation, P(+|psi) + P(+|reversed psi) = 1
    is forced by QLF_BasisIndependence, and the script says so. For a branch pair no relabeling can
    exchange the sums are 1.878 and 0.352 -- not complementary. The identity is a consistency check,
    never evidence.
  * **Unweighted over depth, the stopping scale is still a knob.** P(+|d) decays monotonically
    toward 1/2 as the closure depth grows (1.000, .962, .917, ... .690 at d = 15, R = 3), so both
    pre-registered aggregations -- coherent |sum_d A_c(d)|^2 and incoherent sum_d |A_c(d)|^2 --
    drift with the cutoff, and agree with each other to three digits, so the choice between them is
    not what is at stake.
  * **The depth measure is not a free choice after all: it is counted.** First closures are
    **prefix-free** (a run that has closed is not continued, so no first-closure word extends
    another), so the global cylinder measure on the Sigma_8 tree, mu(h) = 8^-|h|, is available and
    Kraft's inequality bounds the total at 1 with no probability theory -- just finite counting: at
    a common horizon K each first closure at depth d owns 8^(K-d) of the 8^K complete histories, and
    those sets are disjoint. The QLF reading is the multiplicity one: **an earlier closure weighs
    more because more complete histories contain it.** Capacity then causes **leakage**, never
    renormalisation -- the mass that never closes here is simply missing from the total, and one
    conditions once at the end. Measured, exactly: Kraft mass 1.000 (aligned), .321 (transverse),
    .180 (ZX mix) at R = 3, always at or below 1, always monotone. An earlier version of this
    weighting divided depth by depth by the *surviving capacity-limited* population instead and
    summed past 1 (1.02, 1.11); that was the error, not the measure.
  * **Under that measure the multiplicity reading converges and the amplitude reading does not --
    and that is the sharp obstruction.** Conditioned on closure, the counting probability
    P(c | closure) is knob-free, direction-sensitive, and settling in capacity: aligned 1.000,
    transverse .500, ZX-mix .9164/.9023/.9005 at R = 3/4/5 and .8600/.8237/.8151 for the deeper mix.
    But both phase-weighted forms **diverge**: a Born weight needs |A_c(d)| to grow no faster than
    sqrt(8)^d = 2.828^d, and the measured growth is 3.91^d, 4.35^d, 4.56^d at R = 3, 4, 5 -- the gap
    *widening* with capacity. **QLF's own phases cancel too weakly to define an amplitude under the
    one measure that makes its counts summable.** And since counts are provably not weights
    (interference is real -- QLF_Degeneracy), the convergent counting probability is not a Born rule
    either. That is where the route stands: a derived measure, a convergent multiplicity, and a
    quantitative threshold (2.828^d) that the signed census misses.

The normalized-event weight: multiplicity times squared mean phase
------------------------------------------------------------------
The divergence above is a normalisation, not a verdict. The raw signed sum treats each closing
word as its own outcome; if instead the W words that close as the same event at the same depth are
W *ways of one event*, the weight carries the many-to-one normalisation:

    B(c) = sum_d  A_c(d)^2 / (W_c(d) . 8^d)  =  sum_d (W_c(d)/8^d) . (A_c(d)/W_c(d))^2
                                                 multiplicity mass    coherence fraction

-- frequency from how many ways the event happens, interference from how coherently those ways add.
Nothing is fitted: the depth factor is the cylinder measure and the divisor is the size of the event
class. **Summability is then automatic**, since |A| <= W gives A^2/W <= W and Kraft bounds the rest
(lean/QLF_KraftMeasure.lean) -- convergence no longer depends on how strongly the phases cancel.

Measured, exactly, and it is the best-behaved construction in this file:

  * it **converges absolutely and fast** -- stable to 8 digits by depth 16, with no cutoff anywhere;
  * it is **nearly capacity-independent**: the ZX mix reads .99386152 at R = 3 against .99383011 at
    R = 4, a fifth-digit difference where every earlier reading moved in the first or second;
  * the limiting cases come out right: aligned 1.000000 (one closure, at depth 0), transverse
    .500000, and reversing the preparation gives the exact complement;
  * fully coherent ways keep their whole multiplicity mass, perfectly cancelling ways weigh zero.

**And it still does not render an angle, which is the test that matters.** Sweeping the apparatus
does not sweep the weight. Adding transverse letters one at a time gives 2.acos(sqrt(P)) = 0, 8.99,
13.04, 10.37, 12.89, 11.13 degrees for a = 0..5 -- wobbling, never accumulating, where a rotation
would step. A grid of apparatus with m Z-letters and n X-letters sits at .97-.99 almost everywhere
regardless of n/m, with one outlier at (m,n) = (2,1) that inverts to .075. And *order* dominates
composition: the same two letters give exactly .5 as X-then-Z and .994 as Z-then-X. Note also that
both values this construction gets right are symmetry-forced (aligned has a single closure;
transverse is QLF_BasisIndependence), so the free content is exactly the part that does not look
like quantum mechanics.

So the measure question is settled and the amplitude question is not: the honest statement is that
this weight is well-defined, convergent and parameter-free, and that its unforced values are not a
cos^2 family. The decisive next test is a geometry with a known QM answer that is *not* forced --
two-path interference, or the singlet -- which needs multi-history closure rather than a new
weighting.
