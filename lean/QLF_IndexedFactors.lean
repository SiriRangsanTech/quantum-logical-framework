# QLF_IndexedFactors — many bodies need **indexed copies** of the eight twists, not more twists

The question this settles: does a multi-body inventory need new primitive twist directions —
`^`, `2^`, `3^`, … as distinct letters? **No.** The alphabet stays `Σ₈`; what a second body needs is
a *label*, so that a token is `(factor, twist) ∈ ℕ × Σ₈` — independent **uses** of the same `^`, never
a new kind of `^`. That matches [`eight-twists-sufficiency.md`](../eight-twists-sufficiency.md): higher
dimension comes from parallel composition, not from enlarging the basis.

What indexing changes is the **algebra**, and that is where the real content is.

## Independent factors commute; flat concatenation does not

An operation on body 1 and one on body 2 act as `A ⊗ I` and `I ⊗ B`, which **commute**
(`indexed_factors_commute`). Flattened into one word they land in a single Pauli algebra where
distinct axes **anticommute** — `σy σx = −σx σy` ([`anti_yx`](QLF_BasisIndependence.lean)). So
concatenation is not a faithful model of two independent bodies: `not_all_flat_pairs_commute`
exhibits the failure with `^` and `>`.

## But the flat model is not simply wrong — the two are different sectors

A Kronecker product is a scalar exactly when both factors are, so **a joint closure of independent
factors requires each factor to close on its own**. In the flat model a factor may stay *open* and be
balanced by the other — and that is precisely `SharedClosure` ([`ER_EPR_QLF`](ER_EPR_QLF.lean)),
QLF's entanglement. Hence the split:

* **product sector** — both factors close alone: genuinely independent bodies, tensor-valid;
* **coupled sector** — neither closes alone, the pair does: entanglement, and it exists **only** under
  concatenation.

**`shared_closure_not_factorizable`** proves the coupled sector is non-empty in the sharpest way: the
primordial witness `^ | v` is jointly balanced while *neither* side folds to a scalar. So indexing
cannot simply replace concatenation — an interaction binding two bodies is a genuine Pauli **string**
`σ ⊗ σ`, not a product of single-factor operators. Measured in
[`census_inventory.py`](../census_inventory.py)'s factor inventory, the coupled sector is the *majority*
and grows with length: `0.750`, `0.791`, `0.804` of shared closures at lengths 2, 4, 6.

## Where the phase does factorize — and the correction that earned it

For the product sector the phase multiplies: **`fold_scalar_factorizes`**. Note the group is `μ₄`, not
`μ₂`. An open factor is *not* count-balanced, so [`balanced_phase_is_real`](QLF_BalancedPhaseReal.lean)
does not apply to it and its scalar may be `±i`; a `μ₂`-valued rule cannot express that. Asserting the
`μ₂` version is an error the inventory's checker caught — the `μ₂` restriction is a fact about
*closures*, and a **factor** of a closure needs the full group.

No axioms.

    factors are, no assignment of these two histories to independent indexed bodies can reproduce this
    closure — it exists only under concatenation. So indexing the alphabet by body **cannot replace**
    joint closure; binding two bodies takes a genuine Pauli string `σ ⊗ σ`, not a product of

/-- **Established constructively, no axioms.** A many-body inventory does **not** need new primitive
    twists: a token is `(factor, twist) ∈ ℕ × Σ₈` (`IndexedTwist`), an indexed *use* of the same eight
    (`twistOf_mem_alphabet`). What indexing changes is the algebra — independent bodies commute
    (`indexed_factors_commute`) where a flat word puts them in one Pauli algebra and makes them
    anticommute (`not_all_flat_pairs_commute`). The two models are therefore **two sectors, not
    rivals**: where both bodies close on their own the phase simply multiplies in `μ₄`
    (`fold_scalar_factorizes`, `product_sector_order_free`) and the models agree; where neither closes
    alone but the pair does — `SharedClosure`, entanglement — the closure has **no product form at
    all** (`shared_closure_not_factorizable`, the `^ | v` witness), since a Kronecker product is scalar
    only when both factors are. The gauge pair `+ | −` shows the boundary is sharp by falling on the
    other side (`gauge_pair_is_product_sector`). **Consequence:** index the inventory, but do not let
    indexing replace concatenation — the coupled sector is the majority (`0.750`, `0.791`, `0.804` of
    shared closures at lengths 2, 4, 6, from the factor inventory) and it is exactly where entanglement
    lives. -/
