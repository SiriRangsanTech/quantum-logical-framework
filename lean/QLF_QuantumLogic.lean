# QLF_QuantumLogic — the substrate realizes the minimal quantum logic MO2

*Does ZFA model fundamental quantum logic?* Quantum logic (Birkhoff–von Neumann 1936) is the
**orthomodular, non-distributive** lattice of a quantum system's propositions — classical (Boolean)
logic is the distributive special case, and the *defining* departure from classical logic is
**non-distributivity** for incompatible observables. This module proves that the substrate realizes the
**minimal genuinely-quantum logic `MO2`** — the height-2 orthomodular lattice `0 < {x, x⊥, z, z⊥} < 1`
of two *incompatible* propositions — **fully machine-verified, no bridge axiom**:

* The two atoms `ax`, `az` are the **x-spin and z-spin ZFA closures**. They are **incompatible** because
  their Pauli operators do not commute — `incompatibility_source` re-exports `QLF_Spin.su2_comm_zx`
  (`σz σx − σx σz = 2i σy ≠ 0`; cf. `PauliExclusion.fermi_nonzero_example`). Compatible (commuting)
  propositions generate a Boolean block; this incompatibility is *exactly* what makes the realized lattice
  the non-distributive `MO2`.
* **`le_refl` / `le_trans` / `le_antisymm`** — the propositions form a **partial order** (implication).
* **`compl_involutive`** (`a⊥⊥ = a`) + **`compl_antitone`** (order-reversing) + **`inf_compl_bot`**
  (`a ∧ a⊥ = 0`) + **`sup_compl_top`** (`a ∨ a⊥ = 1`) — a genuine **orthocomplemented** lattice (the
  orthocomplement is the Hermitian-conjugate / opposite-twist closure, `QLF_Spin`, `QLF_ProperInvolution`).
* **`orthomodular`** — the **orthomodular law** `a ≤ b ⟹ b = a ∨ (a⊥ ∧ b)` holds (weaker than
  distributivity; the law that makes it a *quantum* logic).
* **`not_distributive`** — and it is **NOT** Boolean: `ax ∧ (az ∨ az⊥) = ax` but
  `(ax ∧ az) ∨ (ax ∧ az⊥) = 0 ≠ ax` — the genuine quantum non-distributivity, from the incompatibility.

So on the substrate, quantum logic's defining feature is **realized, not merely analogized**: a concrete
finite ZFA proposition lattice that is orthomodular and provably non-distributive.

## Scope

This is a *complete, axiom-free* proof that the substrate realizes the **minimal** quantum logic `MO2`
(the smallest non-Boolean orthomodular lattice, the incompatible-qubit case). It does **not** prove the
**general representation theorem** — that an *arbitrary* orthomodular ZFA proposition lattice embeds into
the projection lattice of a Hilbert space (Piron/Solèr, dim ≥ 3) — which is the **Gleason-hard
reconstruction bridge** already located: the substrate dagger is a proper involution
(`QLF_ProperInvolution.substrate_dagger_proper`, the (a1) rung), the finite measure-uniqueness is done
(`QLF_Reconstruction.measure_unique`), and the projection-lattice / Baer-`*`-ring step is the named
settled-math bridge Mathlib lacks (`Completeness_Evidence.md` §6c). So: minimal quantum logic **proven**;
the general Hilbert representation is the existing named bridge — the "verified discrete core + one bridge"
Millennium pattern. Reuses `QLF_Spin`; no new axioms. See `Quantum_Logic_Foundations.md`.

    distributivity, machine-verified on the substrate proposition lattice. -/
theorem orthomodular : ∀ a b : QL, le a b = true → b = sup a (inf (compl a) b) := by decide

/-- **NOT distributive — genuinely quantum.** For the incompatible atoms `ax`, `az`:
    `ax ∧ (az ∨ az⊥) = ax ∧ ⊤ = ax`, but `(ax ∧ az) ∨ (ax ∧ az⊥) = ⊥ ∨ ⊥ = ⊥ ≠ ax`. The distributive
    law fails exactly for incompatible propositions — the substrate realizes true quantum logic, not the
    Boolean shadow. -/
theorem not_distributive :
    ∃ a b c : QL, inf a (sup b c) ≠ sup (inf a b) (inf a c) :=
  ⟨ax, az, azp, by decide⟩

/-- **The source of incompatibility — the non-commuting spin axes.** `ax` (x-spin) and `az` (z-spin) are
    incompatible because their Pauli operators do not commute: `σz σx − σx σz = 2i σy ≠ 0`
    (`QLF_Spin.su2_comm_zx`; the `≠ 0` witness is `PauliExclusion.fermi_nonzero_example`). Commuting
    (compatible) propositions would generate a *Boolean* block; this non-commutativity is what forces the
    realized lattice to be the non-distributive `MO2` (`not_distributive`). -/
theorem incompatibility_source :
    σz * σx - σx * σz = (2 * Complex.I) • σy :=
  QLF.Spin.su2_comm_zx

/-- **Established (`Quantum_Logic_Foundations.md`).** The substrate realizes the **minimal quantum logic
    `MO2`**: the ZFA propositions form a partial order (`le_refl/trans/antisymm`), orthocomplemented by the
    Hermitian-conjugate closure (`compl_involutive`, `compl_antitone`, `inf_compl_bot`, `sup_compl_top`),
    satisfying the **orthomodular law** (`orthomodular`) but **not distributive** (`not_distributive`) —
    because the two atoms are the *incompatible* (non-commuting) x-spin and z-spin closures
    (`incompatibility_source`). Quantum logic's defining feature is thus **realized, not analogized**.
    **Open (the named bridge, not a gap here):** the general representation of an *arbitrary* orthomodular
    ZFA lattice as a Hilbert projection lattice (Piron/Solèr, dim ≥ 3) — the Gleason-hard reconstruction
    step (`QLF_ProperInvolution`, `QLF_Reconstruction`, `Completeness_Evidence.md` §6c). Reuses `QLF_Spin`;
    no new axioms. -/
