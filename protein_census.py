protein_census.py — the folding census: a fold is a closure inventory.

Chemistry.md gets molecules from one rule (a bond is a shared closure) and stops at
stoichiometry, because a small molecule has no shape to speak of. A polymer does. This
script is the census that takes the rule to conformation, and it is built on one
observation: **a backbone step is already a twist**. A chain on the cubic lattice moves by
one of six signed axis displacements, and the 8-twist alphabet is the signed axis frame,
so a conformation IS a twist history (lean/QLF_Folding.lean).

Everything else follows from counting that history:

  * A **contact** is a ZFA closure — the segment between two touching residues plus the
    contact edge has zero net displacement, hence is count-balanced, hence Pauli-closed by
    `count_balanced_pauli_closed`. Verified here at runtime against `twist_core.is_zfa` on
    every contact loop enumerated (invariant I1).
  * Contacts occur only at **odd** sequence separation — the lattice-protein parity rule,
    proven in Lean as a corollary of count balance (I2).
  * The **contact quantum is log 2** (QLF_FreeEnergy): a fold's free energy is
    -(contacts) x log 2 nats, so the lattice contact energy is derived, not fitted.

The output is an **inventory in the shared `closures` schema** — the same one
data/census_inventory.json uses and the Rust `qucalc` crate loads
(rchain-community/rchain-rust, qucalc/src/lib.rs). Each entry is
`event_classes[branch][class] = {signed, ways}` with **ways held as a coefficient**: a
fold reachable N ways is ONE weighted class, not N terms. That is the whole answer to
Levinthal — the exponential is a number in a record, never a list to be searched — and it
means `qucalc::most_ways_first` ranks these censuses with no new code:

    fold|...          -> most_ways_first gives the native fold
    designability|4x4 -> most_ways_first gives the most designable structure
    loopclosure|...   -> most_ways_first gives the folding ORDER (short loops first)

Usage:
    python3 protein_census.py                # full run, writes data/folding_census.json
    python3 protein_census.py --quick        # cheap re-run + assert every invariant (CI)
    python3 protein_census.py --saw-len 13   # push the 2-D walk census one length deeper

# event worth exactly one bit, so `dF = -log 2` nats per contact (QLF_FreeEnergy). A
# conformation with c contacts therefore carries Boltzmann weight

# the free-energy quantum, read as a count: closing a binary distinction multiplies the

# `most_ways_first` on it is the folding transition rather than an energy minimisation.
